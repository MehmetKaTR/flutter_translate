## Overview

**Project Easy Translate** is an innovative language learning and translation tool that leverages advanced AI techniques to generate engaging stories. The project enables users to learn vocabulary contextually by selecting desired words within the story, making language acquisition natural and immersive.

Built with **Flutter** for a seamless cross-platform mobile experience, it integrates a custom deep learning model called **DeepSeek** that dynamically generates narratives tailored to the user’s vocabulary goals. Besides story generation, the app also offers robust translation features to aid comprehension across multiple languages.

- **Dynamic word selection:** Users pick target words to focus on; the story adapts accordingly.  
- **Multi-language translation:** Supports translating stories and individual words to enhance understanding.  
- **Custom DeepSeek model:** Proprietary deep learning model optimized for contextual language learning.  
- **Flutter-based cross-platform app:** Runs smoothly on both Android and iOS devices.

## How It Works

1. **Choose your target words:** Select the vocabulary you want to practice.  
2. **Generate story:** DeepSeek crafts a unique story embedding those words in meaningful contexts.  
3. **Read & interact:** Follow the story, learn new words naturally, and use integrated translation to clarify meanings.  
4. **Repeat & expand:** Add new words or translate to other languages as your learning progresses.
